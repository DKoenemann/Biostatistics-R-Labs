# Biostatistics-R-Labs
A collection of introductory lab modules for undergraduate and graduate students, focused on biostatistical computing in R and R Studio.

This repository includes all the files and information necessary to "run" this series of labs over the course of a typical American university semester. 

In this repository, you will find a zipped folder ("DataSets.zip") containing all of the datasets used by the lab modules. 
These datasets are derived from uploads to Dryad, R datasets, and my own personal datasets.
Citations for each of the datasets are found in the this same folder. 

In this repository, each lab module is uploaded as its own file in .docx format.
